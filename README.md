===========

Currently only cost expencive solutions for Motion-Capture Systems suitable for Smart-Rooms are available. A cheap solution like the Microsoft Kinect has only a maximum range of about 3.5 Meters which is not suitable for controlling Smart-Rooms.  

The aim of this project is to detect motions and gestures based markers placed on an actors body. To detect the movements usual webcams should be used. Special Markers (e.g. different colors) are placed on a human body and their position gets triangulated using multiple cameras placed within the room. A software system detects analyses the data to detect movements and gestures in order to control devices like a TV or a HIFI System.

The result of this thesis should be a working motion capture system which can be established in any room without the immense costs of thousands of Euros. The scientific findings of the paper should show up complexities and problems creating such systems.
